# Course Registration Bot
The following is a script I wrote for my univeristy's UT course registration
portal using Python and the Selenium web-automation framework.

## Instructions
1). Make sure you have **Python** and **pip** installed. You can grab the latest version from
their official download page: <br />
https://www.python.org/downloads/
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

2). For this program, you will need to use the **Google Chrome** browser. If you do not already have that installed, navigate to their official page to download the latest version (for Windows, macOS, or Linux): <br />
https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download/ <br />
**Make sure your Chrome browswer is on the latest up-to-date version**.

3). In order to use this program on your computer, open up a terminal and type (Recommend to create a folder on desktop for this): <br>
`git clone https://github.com/Ryanho12123/Course-Registration-Bot.git` <br />
If you do not have git installed, you can either download it from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads <br />
Or you can just click the green Code button, Download ZIP, and then extract the folder.

4). In a terminal and while in the directory of this folder, type: <br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt` and then after run `pip install webdriver-manager`

5). Run the code by typing: <br />
`python main.py` or `python3 main.py`

MUST MANUALLY DO DUO AUTHENTICATION

6). Follow the on-screen instructions **carefully** and you should be good to go!
